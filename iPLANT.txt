This is an ML project which detects the plant disease occured to the plant.
It uses RGB values to calculate the weigths and image difference using pixel size, it distributes 
the weights and we use convolution 2D for creating layers.
The dataset has been taken from the Kaggle.
Keras are used for creating the mathematical equations for the calculation of weigths.
